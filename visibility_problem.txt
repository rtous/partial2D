keypoint visibility problem

In COCO, if conf is 0 keypoints are 0. Why then I'm drawing good keypoints that I'm trying to replace?

- I draw pairs of keypoints if they coordinates are different than zero. Not using any confidence value here

- ablation dataset: 
    openPoseUtils.removeBones:
        if (hasPart(newKeypoints, "MidHip") and hasPart(newKeypoints, "Neck")) or (hasPart(newKeypoints, "Neck") and hasPart(newKeypoints, "Nose")) or (hasPart(newKeypoints, "Nose") and hasPart(newKeypoints, "REye")):
        return newKeypoints

    openPoseUtils.hasPart: if keypoints[index][2] > 0 (it's using confidence)
    
    tryAddingNewCroppedVariation:
        magnitude_bone = magnitude_bone_from_index(variation, referenceBoneIndex)
        if magnitude_bone == 0:

        it's using "hasBone", that do not check confidence
