(learning GANs)

- GAN for CELEB faces from Pytorch tutorials. 
	(convolutional, batch normalization)
	(strange: the noise vector within the channels...)
	(tested also a linear version)

- GAN for MNIST digits (myself)
	- same as (1)
	- flat, with a flat noise vector

- Conditional GAN for MNIST (myself)

- Inpainting faces with a Context Encoder

-------------------------------------
20-10-2021: GAN for pose generation. Input/output = normalized keypoints from H36M_ECCV18_FILTERED.


31-10-2021: Tested the ouput keypoints with smplify-x, it seems to work! :-)

MISSING: 
	- Normalize and center keypoints? 
	- Better prefiltering for the dataset? 
	- Explore deep learning for low dimensional data: overfitting problem
	- Alernatives: Bayesian deep neural (no overfit), radial basis function network
	- Alternative representation of the data: heatmaps, images, etc.
