(learning GANs)

- GAN for CELEB faces from Pytorch tutorials. 
	(convolutional, batch normalization)
	(strange: the noise vector within the channels...)
	(tested also a linear version)

- GAN for MNIST digits (myself)
	- same as (1)
	- flat, with a flat noise vector

- Conditional GAN for MNIST (myself)

- Inpainting faces with a Context Encoder

20-10-2021: GAN for pose generation. Input/output = normalized keypoints from H36M_ECCV18_FILTERED.


31-10-2021: Tested the ouput keypoints with smplify-x, it seems to work! :-)

POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS: 
	- Normalize and center keypoints? 
	- Better prefiltering for the dataset? 
	- Explore deep learning for low dimensional data: overfitting problem
	- Alernatives: Bayesian deep neural (no overfit), radial basis function network
	- Alternative representation of the data: heatmaps, images, etc.  
-------------------------------------
01-10-2021: Design of the pose inpainting network

	1) From H36M generate of images with occlusions
	2) With openpose generate pairs of (keypoints, keypoints with occlusions)
	3) Network (similar to the Context Encoder:

	keypoints with occlusions -> GENERATOR -> full keypoints -> use the originals where condfident? = fake keypoints
                                                        
	(fake keypoints, , keypoints with occlusions) -> DISCRIMINATOR 
	and also
	(keypoints, keypoints with occlusions)

	WARNING: The keypoints with occlusions generated by openpose may be globally different?

08-11-2021: Testing of the pose inpainting network

	WARNING: The normalization takes the spine index, why if it's not present?
