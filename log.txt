1) GAN for CELEB faces from Pytorch tutorials. 
	(convolutional, batch normalization)
	(strange: the noise vector within the channels...)
	(tested also a linear version)

2) GAN for MNIST digits (myself)
	- same as (1)
	- flat, with a flat noise vector

3) Condition GAN for MNIST 

4) Inpainting with a Context Encoder
