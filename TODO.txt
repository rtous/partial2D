Things to consider:
	- only taking 65536 poses from H36M
	- normalization not in 0-1
	- not training with openpose outputs



- More data? COCO, PANOPTIC? Projections from 3D datasets?
- Check ablation
- Check prefiltering, with wich images are we really training?
- Review normalization 
- Us less joints, as in coco?
- Alternative representation of the data: heatmaps, images, etc.  
- Improve the model:
	- the patch part in the context encoder
	- solve overfitting problem in low dimensional data

-----------------------------------
ADVANCED:

- Explore deep learning for low dimensional data: overfitting problem
- Alernatives: Bayesian deep neural (no overfit), radial basis function network
