- EasyMocap (https://github.com/zju3dv/EasyMocap) which is used in CEB EasyMocap Monocular uses HRNET and OpenPose for internet videos -> Keep working!

- IDEA: First improve the model, match the FID! Try a VAE
- Seen this about VAEs and low dimensional data: https://openreview.net/forum?id=y_op4lLLaWL
- ELBO = evidence lower bound = negative variational free energy
- "evidence" = likelihood function evaluated at a fixed θ: logp(x;θ)

- VAE seems the way, but need a condition
- Try CVAE!! (also can try VAE-Info-CGAN and variations)
- https://github.com/unnir/cVAE/blob/master/cvae.py

- The CVAE gives negative values
- Tried a lower nz = 10, no improvement
- Let's try first a normal VAE: https://debuggercafe.com/getting-started-with-variational-autoencoder-using-pytorch/

NO, let's try the VAE without the classes. It works for MNIST

- Same problem...
- IDEA: Be able to obtain a low FID with just an autoencoder, without truncations

HINT: Negative losses because using BCE instead of MSE (MNIST is binary!!)

- SOLVED!!! The sigmoid in the output of the decoder forced data in the range [0, 1] and my data is not there!!!! now it works!!! maybe I should change the data??
